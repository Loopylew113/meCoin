# meCoin-Official
The official and original client for meCoin!
-------------------------
So, to start off. Download your chosen packages, if you're on windows, you're looking for the .zip and .exe files. If you want the wallet client alone, to store, transact and stake your meCoins. Download the "meCoin Wallet" client. Open it up and you're already set, your wallet will sync without the need of a .conf due to hardcoded node support.

if you're looking to mine, our coin's mining phase is now over, meaning we can ONLY be staked or transacted, sorry miners!

To purely stake, download your meCoin wallet, recieve your coins in the 'recieve' tab and your meCoin address (however many you have, choose one). Simply leave your wallet open, un-encrypted, and you will recieve stakes based on the APR percentage (18%), the weight, or amount of meCoins you have, and the net-weight of all other stakers. The higher your own weight, the better quality stakes you recieve.

If you're a 'masternode' holder, your coins will have enough weight to outrun most other stakers (as intended, since there are no systems in place, your 'masternode' coin's stakes are currently your rewards) meaning you have much larger and frequent stakes compared to the rest of the network, again, these masternodes are not traditional, and there are no systems in place currently to fit in a masternode system.
